Select *
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
order by 3,4


-- Narrow the data that we are going to focus on

Select Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
order by 1,2


-- Next I analyze Total Cases vs Population
-- Data will show what percentage of the population is infected with Covid

Select Location, date, Population, total_cases,  (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
order by 1,2

-- On this part I analyze the Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- Shows how likely you are to die if you get infected by each country

Select Location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where location like '%states%'
and continent is not null 
order by 1,2

-- Next I show the Countries with the Highest Infection Rate compared to Population

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- Next I show the Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

Select Location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--We can add here -> Where location like '%states%'
Where continent is not null 
Group by Location
order by TotalDeathCount desc



-- Below I break down the data per continent

-- Here showing contintents with the highest death count per population

Select continent, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
-- Same, Where location like '%states%'
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent
order by TotalDeathCount desc



-- Now I filter the result as a global population

Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
-- Same, Where location like '%states%'
where continent is not null 
-- We can play with date, Group By date
order by 1,2



-- Next I move into Total Population vs Vaccinations
-- It will show the percentage of population that have received at least one shot

Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated

From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac

-- Next I use a CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query

-- Now I use a Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By of previous query

DROP Table if exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Create Table #PercentPopulationVaccinated

Date datetime,
Population numeric,

Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100

-- Next I use Create View to store data for later display

Create View PercentPopulationVaccinated as
